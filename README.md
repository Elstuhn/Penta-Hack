# Pentahack - Educational PDF Summarization with NLP Transformer
Welcome to our project!, where we present an AI model for educational PDF summarization using state-of-the-art NLP Transformer model! In this hackathon project, we have built an AI model that can summarize educational PDF documents into concise and informative text summaries.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and time-saving solution for students and researchers to quickly get the key takeaways from lengthy academic papers, reports, and textbooks. Our model utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately parse and understand the content of PDF documents and generates concise summaries of the document's key points using NLP Transformer models.

## Resources
Our project uses the following resources:

- [A dataset of wikipedia descriptions and summary for training and evaluation purposes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jordiclive/wikipedia-summary-dataset)

- [Pre-trained NLP Transformer model from Facebook (BART)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461)

Python libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow for building and training our deep learning model
PDF parsing libraries like PyPDF2 and PDFMiner for extracting the content of the PDFs
Tech stacks such as Supabase, ReactJS and TailwindCSS for the frontend 

## Usage
1. cd into the folder
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. cd into backend and run main.py (will start downloading model)
4. go to the localhost link provided and register
5. login to your account and upload any PDF document
