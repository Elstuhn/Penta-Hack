# Code for 2023 Penta Hack Hackathon


Pentahack - Educational PDF Summarization with NLP Transformer
Welcome to our project!, where we present an AI model for educational PDF summarization using state-of-the-art NLP Transformer model! In this hackathon project, we have built an AI model that can summarize educational PDF documents into concise and informative text summaries.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and time-saving solution for students and researchers to quickly get the key takeaways from lengthy academic papers, reports, and textbooks. Our model utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately parse and understand the content of PDF documents and generates concise summaries of the document's key points using NLP Transformer models.

Resources
Our project uses the following resources:

A dataset of educational PDF documents for training and evaluation purposes

[Pre-trained NLP Transformer model from Facebook (BART)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461)
Python libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow for building and training our deep learning model
PDF parsing libraries like PyPDF2 and PDFMiner for extracting the content of the PDFs
Usage
To use our model, simply upload an educational PDF document to our web application, and our model will generate a concise summary of the document's key points.
